NEM is being written from scratch with 100% original code, sharing nothing with any other digital currency. NEM is not just a currency, but a technological platform. It has the ability to support many activities which involve a trust-less consensus between two parties: a decentralised exchange, messaging, reputation systems etc. However, NEM is more than this. This movement was built upon foundations of fairness, equality and solidarity; foundations which every NEM stakeholder and user should respect and try to adhere to.",

When you take certain actions, we send a code to your phone to verify that it's you taking the action.\"",
      "buyingBitcoin4": "You are almost done, now it's time to enter the method of payment you plan to use. Using a credit card results in an instant transfer of Bitcoin to your account, but some company's charge a fee (I was charged a 2.9% fee, but your expereience could vary). You can also link a bank account, and pay 0 fees, but that will take a few days to be verified.",
      "buyingBitcoin5": "Now it is time to make the purchase, on the home page, click <a href=\"https://www.circle.com/deposit\">Add Funds</a>. You will see a page similar to the image below. Simply choose one of the funding sources you added in the previous step, and enter the amount of USD or other fiat you want to convert into Bitcoin.<br> To learn more about how to use circle, check out their <a href=\"https://support.circle.com/hc/en-us/articles/201207324\">Tips</a> page.",

      "buyingNem": "Buying NEM",
      "buyingNem1": "Congratulations, you now have Bitcoin! To purchase NEM, you will need to use an exchange such as Poloniex.  Creating an account there is nearly identical to circle.",
      "buyingNem1-1":"However it should be faster as you will not be prompted to add features such as 2 factor authentication (although I highly reccomend enabling 2FA, there is a link under your username).",
      "buyingNem2": "Once logged into your Poloniex account, click on the \"Balances\" tab, and scroll down to [BTC] Bitcoin, and click on \"Generate New BTC Address\".<br>Take a note of this address, you will need it for your next step.",
      "buyingNem3": "From your circle home page, choose \"SEND MONEY\".<br>Take the BTC address you created in the previous step, and paste it into the \"To\" field, then write the amount (In Fiat), that you want to transfer to Poloniex. If this is your first time doing something like this, I highly reccomend sending a small test payment first.<br>You are almost there, this transfer will take a few minutes to be verified, so don't worry if it doesn't happen as fast as the purchase on circle.",
      "buyingNem4": "Once your Bitcoins are in your Poloniex wallet, you are ready to buy NEM. Poloniex, and most other exchanges, offer multiple ways to buy or sell cryptocurrencies, but I will outline the simplest way. Click on the exchanges tab, and click on NEM in the BTC Markets on the top right portion of the screen. Now Scroll down past \"Buy NEM\" to view the \"Sell Orders\". These orders are put up by people that have NEM, and are looking to trade it for BTC. Simply select the topmost Sell order, you will notice that the \"Buy NEM\" box is now filled with the order you just clicked on. Select \"Buy\", and you are now a proud owner of NEM.",
